        <p > "I'm so glad I stumbled upon this late-night food truck! The food is amazing and exactly what I need after a night out. Not only that, but it's much cheaper than ordering delivery from Uber Eats. I love the convenience of being able to grab a delicious meal right on the street, and the prices are definitely more student-budget-friendly. This food truck is a game-changer for my late-night cravings!"</p>
